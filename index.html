            <h1>What makes music great?</h1>
            <p>Head bobbing. Foot tapping. Snapping of the fingers. 
                You must be listening to good music, correct? 
                Yes, you are correct. What makes music great are a vast amount of factors like lyrics, production, and catchy hooks. 
                We won't get into the specifics of a great song but merely showcasing great songs themselves. 
                I behold to you, my top-5 songs of all-time. Enjoy.
